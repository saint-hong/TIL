## Explore GitHub!!

I was curious about other peopl's blogs.\
Click on the Exploration menu to navigate the pages of oter users.\
There were pages that shared good information.\
Among them, i followed the pages that shared the Python code.\
And i also saw information about Git Hub conference 2020. \
If i become a data scientist someday, i want to paricipate in various conference.
